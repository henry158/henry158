# PowerMacMisAdventures

So as a project I got two PowerPC Mac's, a Power Mac G5 and a PowerBook G4. As I have expected, I have had large troubles getting linux on the devices, be it they won't detect the DVD in the drive or they won't detect network hardware when it is finally installed after forcing a boot through openfirmware. I think for now, I will go back to osx, and use brew for my project, it will do... for now.
